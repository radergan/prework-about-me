      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Patrick Dalton, nice to meet you!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from the southwest side of Chicago originally, around 63rd and Cicero.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like cooking, even though I am not great at it. I also enjoy art and design, 
        making music and playing computer games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A dream job would be one in which I work with a lot of creative people who have
        great chemistry and senses of humor, on a team lead by supportive managers who 
        encourage creativity.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Irving Park and Damen, neighborhood of North Center - Chicago, IL.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I had the title of web developer for a couple years working with ColdFusion,
        an old web development language - everyone laughs when I mention it. I really like 
        designing and building things, and I want to learn how to build them with modern 
        tools used by real web developers - and not be laughed at!
